# Tokka Engineering Challenge 1

## Setup

Use your perfered package manager to install dependencies. I use pnpm. 

- Frontend: [react](https://github.com/xvin-zr/tokka-challenge1/blob/main/react/README.md)
- Backend: [express](https://github.com/xvin-zr/tokka-challenge1/blob/main/express/README.md)

## Docker

To preview in docker, make sure you are in root directory (where you can see `docker-compose.yml`) and run:
```bash
docker compose up
```

Check the containers are running. Open `http://localhost:4173` in your browser (or the port you've configured).
